A small integration of the GTK main loop into libdispatch

This project examines the integration of GTK into an ObjC2 program
that uses libdispatch for concurrency.

Assumptions:
  - target platform is Linux
  - libdispatch is the source of concurrency

The module gtkgcd.[hc] uses gdk functions to find the file descriptor
for X11 events that GTK is listening for.  It then registers a
dispatch handler this source that updates the GTK display elements.

Files:
  - gtkgcd: registers a listener for X11 events, provides a 'sync'
    function for new events

  - TextWindow: an ObjC2 window that displays log events, and can be
    cleared by pushing the button

  - main: stitches it all together and defines two asynchronous
    dispatch sources to write to the main window.
